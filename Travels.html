  <h1>Travels</h1>
  <p>Traveling has always been a passion of mine. I was privileged to experience a
    good bit when I was young, trips to visit my grandparents in Miami were frequent,
    a few times a year, and the idea that there were places other than where I lived
    with so many vast and minute differences was always fascinating to me. I drank in
    my NatGeo subscription with the incomparable thirst of a child in love with learning,
    I wanted to see every far flung jungle, every gorgeous exotic-creature-laden beach,
    to traipse across the beautiful mountainous expanses on my own expeditions, and see
    the great plains on safari! This was beaten out of me for a time by the hum-drum
    of everyday life and the weight of presumed responsibility to go about the process of
    growing up in a particular way; get a job, get a promotion, get a better job, get a
    house, get a wife, have a family, increase assets, put the kids through school, THEN
    finally be free to travel... Thankfully I realized this was nonsense and that I could
    always come back to everyday life at about 22, and promptly got rid of my apartment,
    rented a room from a guy off Craigslist, and put in my two weeks notice at work within
    the month, despite the rather large promotion they made sure to make me aware I was
    walking away from. What followed were some of the best days of my life thus far, the
    beginning of my travels, and certainly not the end of them. Here's a selection of
    snippets from the journey so far:</p>
